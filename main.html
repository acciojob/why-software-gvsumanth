	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I like the way computers work, computing huge tasks by breaking them into small blocks. I like to solve huge problems, scenarios, break the task into chunks, writing logic for each chunks, searching for edge cases, debugging for hours. Software development is fun.</p>
